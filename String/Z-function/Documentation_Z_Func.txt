Z Algo/Function is related to kmp; bcz it also solves similar problem as kmp does.
So to understand z algo  , lets look the z function on a given string
z function will create a array of similar size whose index i will tell the length of longest substring which starts from index i and that is also a proper prefix.
Note => z function is not defined for index 0;
now i will do coding of z function in Concepts_Z_Function.cpp
