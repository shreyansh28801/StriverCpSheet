it is single source shortest path algo
greedy approach


There are 3 method  to  implement it.
    1- Queue (brute force method)
    2- Priority(min heap) queue(better than 1st)
    3- Set method(mode optimized)

T.C. => E(log(V))
E=no. of edges
V=no of vertices/nodes

Note - 1. If the edge weight is constant then no need to use priority queue and set, we can simply use queue. 
       2. If the weight of edge is either 0 or 1 then we can use deque ; when edge weight is 1 push form back 
	and when edge weight is 0 push from front(this is only possible bcz we have observed that ib bfs traversal
	at a time 2 level exists(current level nodes and next level nodes)
